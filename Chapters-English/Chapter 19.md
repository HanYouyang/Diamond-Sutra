## Chapter 19
The Buddha continued:

“What do you think Subhuti? If a follower were to give away enough treasures to fill 3,000 universes, would a great blessing and merit incur to him or her?”

Subhuti replied, “Honored one, such a follower would acquire considerable blessings and merit.”

The lord Buddha said:

“Subhuti, if such a blessing had any substantiality, if it were anything other than a figure of speech, the Most Honored One would not have used the words ‘blessings and merit’.”
